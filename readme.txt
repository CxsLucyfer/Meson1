MesonÂ® is project to create the best possible next-generation
build system.


Dependencies

Python   http://python.org (version 3.4 or newer)
Ninja    http://martine.github.com/ninja/


Installing from source

You can run Meson directly from a revision control checkout or an
extracted tarball.  Installing it system-wide is simple.

Configure step: None
Compile step:   None
Unit test step: ./run_tests.py
Install step:   [sudo] ./install_meson.py --prefix /your/prefix --destdir /destdir/path

The default value of prefix is /usr/local. The default value of destdir
is empty. 


Running

Meson requires that you have a source directory and a build directory
and that these two are different. In your source root must exist a file
called 'meson.build'. To generate the build system run this command:

meson <source directory> <build directory>

You can omit either of the two directories, and Meson will substitute
the current directory and autodetect what you mean. This allows you to
do things like this:

cd source_root; mkdir build; cd build; meson ..
cd source_root; mkdir build; meson build

To compile, cd into your build directory and type 'ninja'. To run unit
tests, type 'ninja test'.

Install is the same but it can take an extra argument:

DESTDIR=/destdir/path ninja install

DESTDIR can be omitted. If you are installing to system directories,
you may need to run this command with sudo.
