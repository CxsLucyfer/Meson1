description: |
  *Since 0.64.0* Create a custom build target that generates a bunch of files (possibly
  in subdirectories) whose names and paths can't be known beforehand. This function
  is typically used for generating documentation.
  ```meson
  opaque_target('foo',
    command: some_exe,
    install: true
    install_dir: datadir)
  ```

  This function takes all the same keyword arguments as `custom_target` with the
  exception that the `command` kwarg takes only the program to execute, all
  arguments must be specified with the `args` kwargh.

  The return value is a custom target object.

    Meson adds extra integration flags to the process invocation. See the
    [documentation](Custom-build-targets.md) for details.
