      type: int
      description: |
        Left fill the string with zeros until it reaches the length
        specified by this argument. A leading negative sign counts towards
        the length, and is handled by inserting the padding after the `-`
        character rather than before. The original string is returned if the
        value provided is less than or equal to the former's length.
