## Automatically set up Visual Studio environment

When Meson is run on Windows it will automatically set up the
environment to use Visual Studio if no other compiler toolchain
can be detected. This means that you can run Meson commands from
any command prompt or directly from any IDE. This sets up the
64 bit native environment. If you need any other, then you
need to set it up manually as before.
