## Support for ARM Ltd. Clang toolchain

Support for the `armltdclang` compiler has been added. This differs from the
existing `armclang` toolchain in that it is a fork of Clang by ARM Ltd. and
supports native compilation. The Keil `armclang` toolchain only supports
cross-compilation to embedded devices.
