## Removal of the RPM module

Due to lack of interest, lack of maintainership, and lack of a clear purpose,
the RPM module has been removed.

Users interested in one-shot tools to generate an RPM spec file template for
distro packaging, are encouraged develop an external tool that reads the
introspection data.
