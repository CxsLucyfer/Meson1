# Getting meson

## Downloading Meson

Meson releases can be downloaded from the [GitHub release page].

Meson is also available in the [Python Package Index] and can be
installed with `pip3 install meson`.

The newest development code can be obtained directly from [Git]

## Dependencies

Meson is implemented in Python 3. If your operating system provides a
package manager, you should install it with that. For platforms that
don't have a package manager, you need to download it from [Python's
home page].

Depending on your platform and backend you wish to use, you might need
the [Ninja executable]. Again, use your distro-provided version if
possible. Otherwise download it from Ninja project's web site.
