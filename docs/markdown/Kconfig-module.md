# Unstable kconfig module

This module parses Kconfig output files to allow use of kconfig
configurations in meson projects.

**Note**:Â this does not provide kconfig frontend tooling to generate a
configuration. You still need something such as kconfig frontends (see
link below) to parse your Kconfig files, and then (after you've
choosen the configuration options), output a ".config" file.

  [kconfig-frontends]: http://ymorin.is-a-geek.org/projects/kconfig-frontends

## Usage

The module may be imported as follows:

``` meson
kconfig = import('unstable-kconfig')
```

The following functions will then be available as methods on the object
with the name `kconfig`. You can, of course, replace the name
`kconfig` with anything else.

### kconfig.load()

This function loads a kconfig output file and returns a dictionary object.

`kconfig.load()` makes no attempt at parsing the values in the
file.  Therefore, true boolean values will be represented as the string "y"
and integer values will have to be converted with `.to_int()`.

Kconfig frontends usually have ".config" as the default name for the
configuration file.  However, placing the configuration file in the source
directory limits the user to one configuration per source directory.
In order to allow separate configurations for each build directory, as is
the Meson standard, `meson.build` should not hardcode ".config" as the
argument to `kconfig.load()`, and should instead make the argument to
`kconfig.load()` a [project build option](Build-options.md).

* The first (and only) argument is the path to the configuration file to
  load (usually ".config").

**Returns**: a [dictionary object](Reference-manual.md#dictionary-object).
