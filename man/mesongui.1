.SH NAME
mesongui - a gui for the Meson build system
.SH DESCRIPTION

Mesongui provides a graphical user interface to the Meson
build system. It can be used for two main purposes: configuring
an existing build or creating a new build for the given source.

.B mesongui [
.I source or build directory
.B ]

If the argument is a directory with a Meson project, the
Gui will allow you to configure and generate a build tree
for it.

If the argument is an existing build directory, Mesongui will
start a gui that will show all your configuration
options and allows you to change them as desired. The
gui can also be used to build and install the project.
